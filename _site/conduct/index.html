<h2>Vision</h2>
<span class="tagline">The world as we'd like to see it</span>
<p>Government can work for the people, by the people in the digital age.</p>
<p>
  Services can be simple, accessible, and easy to use. Out`comes can be
  measurably better. Better can cost less. We can serve everyone with respect
  and dignity.
</p>
<p>
  It would be the biggest source of societal good for a generation. Let's all
  build it together.
</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<span class="tagline">How we intend to make our vision real</span>
<p>
  Code for NOVA uses the principles and practices of the digital age to improve
  how government serves the American public, and how the public improves
  government.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3 class="countem">To inspire change</h3>
    To inspire public servants, people from the tech sector, and community
    organizers to create change by proving government can do better and showing
    others how.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3 class="countem">To make change real</h3>
    Providing government with access to the resources and digital talent they
    need so that together we can meaningfully impact some of the world's
    toughest societal challenges.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3 class="countem">To make change stick</h3>
    Connecting and convening people from inside and outside government, and from
    all over the world to inspire each other, share success, learn, build, and
    shape a new culture of public service for the 21st century. To do it all at
    scale, serving those who need it most.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Our Values</h2>
<span class="tagline">What we are like as an organization</span>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3 class="countem">Empathy is our operating system.</h3>
    We have a deep empathy for the people we work with. We seek to understand
    the problems they face and we work tirelessly to serve them.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="countem">No one is coming. It's up to us.</h3>
    We don't wait for the powers that be to ask us; we act. We don't ask for
    permission; we find a way. We don't talk change; we deliver it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="countem">Build the movement</h3>
    No one organization can fulfill this vision; we will succeed through a
    movement that invites everyone to roll up their sleeves and do their part.
    In short, cultivate the
    <a
      href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/karass"
      title="A network or group of people who are somehow affiliated or linked spiritually."
      >karass</a
    >.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Our Operating Principles</h2>
<span class="tagline">The ideas that guide the decisions we make</span>
<h3>Solve real problems</h3>
<p>
  We solve problems that real people have, we make sure what we build works for
  them, and we continuously improve it. We solve real problems instead of
  creating elegant code and robust systems to solve imagined ones.
</p>
<h3>Work with, not for</h3>
<p>
  Work with, not for the people we serve. We start with our users, the people
  affected by the service, and understand and respect their needs throughout the
  process. We also respect and support public servants, and when we are critical
  of government outcomes, we blame the system, not the people.<sup>*</sup>
</p>
<h3>We build up</h3>
<p>
  Wer build up from the user to the system, and from the local to the federal.
</p>
<h3>Work lean, iterate quickly</h3>
<p>
  Get a working minimum viable product (MVP) in front of users as early as
  possible and make continuous improvements based on how they use the service.
</p>
<h3>Make it better with data</h3>
<p>
  Inform iterations with data about user behavior. Evaluate programs based on
  statistically-sound ground-truthed data about outcomes.
</p>
<h3>Default to open</h3>
<p>
  Work in the open and collaborate with the community to help make programs and
  services better for everyone.
</p>
<h3>Impact not ideology</h3>
<p>
  Government that works for all people doesn't belong to one party or ideology.
  We welcome all political and social views that respect the principle that
  government should work effectively for all Americans with respect and dignity.
</p>
<h3>Shape the market, don't capture the market</h3>
<p>
  Government that works for all requires the vendor ecosystem to change to
  become more responsive to user needs. We have the potential to create the
  biggest change when our project seek to shape, rather than capture, the market
  for government technology.
</p>
<h3>Non-partisan, but not neutral</h3>
<p>
  We are an alliance of non-partisan groups, but that non-partisanship does not
  imply neutrality. This community has a vision for what government should be
  and will work to bring that vision into reality.
